To set up a Docker container with Nginx as a reverse proxy for multiple React.js application containers on the same server, follow these steps:

## Create a Docker Network
Create a Docker network so that all containers can communicate with each other. This will also make it easier to configure the reverse proxy.

```bash
docker network create network1
```

## React Projects Creation

First, we have to create the 2 react projects we want to access via the reverse proxy.

```bash
npx create-react-app react-project-1
npx create-react-app react-project-2
```
Then, ensure that each React application is correctly running

## Create Container and Export ports

Each React container should expose a port on which the application is running. We can specify the exposed port in the `Dockerfile` or when running the container. 

Here's a suitable  `Dockerfile`:

```bash
FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Here's example for running the container:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 your_image_name
```

For each Dockerfile, we may have a `.dockerignore` file as:
```bash
*/node_modules/
*/build/
*/.git/
.gitignore
Dockerfile
.editorconfig
```

After `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` has been completed, we can build `react-image-1` and `react-image-2` with commands:
```bash
docker image build -t react-image-1 .
docker image build -t react-image-2 .
```
Then, we can  start `app1` and `àpp2` containers with:
```bash
docker run --name app1 --network network1 -d react-image-1
docker run --name app2 --network network1 -d react-image-2
```

## Configure Nginx as Reverse Proxy:

Create an Nginx configuration file defining proxy rules for each React application. Here is the `nginx.conf`, configuration file:

```bash
events {
    worker_connections 1024;  # ajustez selon vos besoins
}

http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        location /app1 {
            proxy_pass http://app1:3000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }

        location /app2 {
            proxy_pass http://app2:3000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }

        # Add more configurations for each React.js application
    }
}
```
We also need a `mime.types` file that contains:

```bash
types {
    text/html                             html htm shtml;
    text/css                              css;
    text/xml                              xml;

    image/jpeg                            jpeg jpg;
    application/javascript                js;
    application/atom+xml                  atom;
    application/rss+xml                   rss;

## Run Nginx Container with Custom Configuration

Start the `Nginx` container by mounting the custom configuration file inside the container.

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 \
--network network1 \
-v "$(pwd)"/nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf \
-v "$(pwd)"/nginx/mime.types:/etc/nginx/mime.types \
-d nginx:latest
```

## Test Your Configuration:

Access your React.js applications via your server's domain or IP address, followed by the path for each application.

For example, if your server is at IP 192.168.1.100 and you configured two React.js applications under paths /app1 and /app2, access them via http://192.168.1.100/app1 and http://192.168.1.100/app2.
